Exercise 1: 

Create a simple webpage, to redirect users to www.google.com if they are under the age of 16. 

Using an external javascript file , Prompt a message "Please enter your age to continue" to users on landing.
if user enters a number greater than or equal to 16 continue. else give appropriate message and redirect. 


Exercise 2: Creating and maintaining js util library

Create a new library myMath.
provide following functions 
add,   - adds two numbers
minus, - subtracts two numbers
multiply - multiply two numbers
divide - divide two numbers
show useful logs for the developers if wrong datatype is used.

assume this library has been in use for some years and now you want to change the name of minus to subtract.
add subtract in a way that all logic is inside subtract method.
For back compatibility minus should still work, code in a way that any enhancement if needed you only have to update one place. 
If someone uses minus method - show a message "minus method is deprecated, please use subtract instead' before returning the result.


Exercise 3:
Add another method power to myMath library.
It should take two arguments
  n an integer number, and p another integer number
  return a value n raised to the power of p.

  solve this using loops. 


Exercise 4:
To promote a new business whenever a transaction is done we want to reward customers with a cashback reward.
Write a function named getCashbackAmount that
  - takes one number argument amount
  - and returns a coupon value based on amount
  < 20    = 3
  20 - 50  = 6
  50 - 75  = 12
  >75  = 14
  handle wrong datatypes passed. if it can be parsed don't throw an error.



Optional Exercise 1 (no submission required) : Javascript can be weird - operation
try to work out result of each before checking the result in console.
console.log("" + 0 + 1);
console.log("" - 2 + 1);
console.log(true + false);
console.log(8 / "4");
console.log("3" * "4");
console.log(8 + 6 + "px");
console.log("$" + 1 + 1);
console.log("42" - 2);
console.log("49em" - 2);
console.log(10 / 0);
console.log("  -99  " + 7);
console.log("  -10  " - 3);
console.log(null + 9);
console.log(undefined + 7);
console.log(" \n " - 2);

Optional Exercise 2 (no submission required): Javascript can be weird - comparison
try to work out result of each before checking the result in console.
console.log("aman" > "chaman");
console.log("67" > "30000");
console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null < 0);
console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null === 0);
console.log(null <= 0); // 
console.log(null == "\n0\n");
console.log(null === +"\n0\n");
console.log(undefined == null);
console.log(undefined === null);
